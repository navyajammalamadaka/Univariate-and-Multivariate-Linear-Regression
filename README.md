# Univariate-and-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

1. Determined the the optimal linear regression coefficients for the data that minimizes mean square error using (1) analytical expression ; and (2) using the "polyfit" and "polyval" functions.
2. Used Linear Regression on a real-world dataset. The datatset contains sales number of a product versus the advertising of the product on TV, radio and newspaper. Observed how advertising on each of these channels impacts sales.
3. Used all three features ('TV', 'Radio', newspaper') to predict sales using multivariate linear regression.
